# VolticCloud
    VolticCloud is an Minecraft-Server-System that can handle proxies and gameservers at one time.
    It can handle more than one Minecraft- or BungeeCord Server, by creating groups of servers.
    It also comes with some nice features, like an in-built SignSystem or even a Webinterface 
    to control your Cloud.
    The VolticCloud has a AddonSystem, that means you can develope an Module with the VolticModule-API
    and load it into your Cloud!
    The Cloud also is smart, for example if your LobbyServer is almost full of players,
    the cloud automaticly creates a new LobbyServer for more players.
    
    The VolticCloud-Team gives you a daily Support. If you need help with your Cloud 
    or the developing of Cloud-Modules we can give Support to you on Discord!
    
    Why don't you try VolticCloud ?
    It will safe you a lot of working time with your Minecraft-Network!
    The Cloud-API also can help you with handleing all your Plug-Ins and Players,
    it makes developing of Plug-Ins easier for you and your Team.
    
    Please Note:
        All of the features that are listed up in the text are *NOT* implemented yet!
        Updates for the Cloud will be released soon, we will also keep you up to date.
