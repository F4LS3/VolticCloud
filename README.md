# VolticCloud
    VolticCloud is an Mincraft-Server-System that can handle proxies and gameservers.
    It can handle more than one Minecraft- or BungeeCord Server, by creating groups of servers.
    It also comes with some nice features, like an in-build SIgnSystem or evan a Webinterface.
    The VolticCloud has a ModuleSystem, that means you can code an Module with the VolticModule-API
    and load it into your Cloud!
    The Cloud also thinks, if for example the lobby-server is full of players,
    the cloud automaticly creates a new lobby server for more players.
    
    Why don't you try VolticCloud ?
    It will help you a lot with your Minecraft-Network!
